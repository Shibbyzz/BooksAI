   - Natural story beats and pacing needs
   - Character development arcs
   - Plot complexity and narrative flow

   - Opening: Character introduction and hook
   - Development: Plot advancement and relationship building  
   - Tension: Conflict escalation and obstacles
   - Climax: Major confrontations and revelations
   - Resolution: Satisfying conclusion and character growth
   
3. Chapter details should include:
   - Compelling title that hints at chapter content
   - Rich 2-3 paragraph summary showing what happens
   - Key story beats and character moments
   - Setting and emotional tone
   - Estimated word count based on content needs (not rigid formulas)

**STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS TO INCLUDE:**
- Opening hook
- Character introduction and motivation
- Rising action with escalating conflict
- Midpoint twist or revelation
- Climax and resolution
- Ending that matches the specified ending type

**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**
- Maintain genre conventions for ${settings.genre}
