The VR experience is enhanced by audio feedback and sometimes even haptic feedback, which simulates touch sensations.",

      "history": "In Sweden, midsommar (Midsummer) is a significant celebration that marks the beginning of summer. It is a time when people gather to celebrate with family and friends, often by dancing around the maypole, enjoying traditional foods like herring and new potatoes, and participating in outdoor activities. Social norms during midsommar include a focus on community, togetherness, and enjoying nature. It is a time for relaxation and bonding with loved ones.. Swedish culture places a strong emphasis on equality, independence, and respect for nature. These values often influence interpersonal relationships and decision-making. Family is also highly valued in Swedish society, and maintaining close relationships with relatives is important.. Swedes tend to be direct and value honesty in communication. They may come across as reserved or formal initially but are generally open to discussing a wide range of topics once a level of trust is established. Non-verbal communication, such as maintaining eye contact and giving personal space, is also important in Swedish culture.. Relationships in Sweden are typically characterized by equality and mutual respect. Gender equality is a fundamental value, and both partners are expected to contribute equally to the relationship. Open communication and a sense of independence are also important aspects of Swedish relationship dynamics."
