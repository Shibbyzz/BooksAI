The city was characterized by its seven hills, including the Palatine Hill where the wealthy lived, and the Capitoline Hill where important temples and government buildings were located. The city was filled with grand marble structures, bustling streets, and crowded markets.. Rome had a Mediterranean climate with hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The city was prone to flooding from the Tiber River, and the surrounding countryside was dotted with vineyards and olive groves.. Roman society was stratified, with the wealthy elite enjoying lavish lifestyles while the lower classes struggled to make a living. Gladiatorial games were a popular form of entertainment, held in grand arenas like the Colosseum. Slavery was widespread, and the city was a melting pot of different cultures and ethnicities.. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, Rome experienced a period of relative peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana. This era saw the expansion of the Roman Empire and the construction of many iconic buildings and monuments.. In Ancient Rome, one would hear the sounds of chariots clattering on cobblestone streets, merchants hawking their wares in the markets, and the roar of the crowd at the Colosseum. The air would be filled with the smells of cooking food, incense from temples, and the sweat and blood of gladiators.. Some notable landmarks in Ancient Rome include the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the Pantheon, and the Circus Maximus. The city was also known for its aqueducts, public baths, and grand villas.",
