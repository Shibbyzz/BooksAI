    "The Amazon rainforest is known for its hot and humid climate, with frequent rainfall creating a constant mist that hangs in the air. The dense canopy overhead blocks out much of the sunlight, casting the forest floor in shadow. The air is filled with the sounds of chirping insects, calling birds, and rustling leaves, creating a cacophony of natural noises.",
